A java library useful for manipulating Minecraft saved data. (NBT, Anvil)

Mojang released a conversion tool that would rewrite old save files
using the new Anvil file format.

They published a .zip file containing source code for that tool.  This
repository starts from that source code and then massages it into a
more reusable form suitable for inclusion in community projects (maven).
